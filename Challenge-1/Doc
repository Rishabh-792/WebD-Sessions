Challenge – 1

In this challenge, you have to try to replicate the website “Museum of Candy”.

All the relevant pictures and videos describing the website can be found in the “Reference” folder.
The images used on the website are stored in the “imgs” folder.

You have to make changes in the “index.html” and “app.css” files as per your understanding from the reference material.

Some important things to consider :
The website must be completely responsive for all screen sizes.
It should include Bootstrap Navbar on top of the page.
The navbar should have a hover effect i.e., on hovering, the colour of the links should change.
The responsiveness can be achieved by using media queries or by using bootstrap grid.
Some add-ons :
You can change the theme of the website according to your preferred aesthetics.
You can add additional bootstrap components if you feel their need.
You can change the images and text with your own materials.

Do note that the objective of this challenge is to apply your understanding and convert your creative ideas to create a nice webpage and learn important HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap stuff along the way.
